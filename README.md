# Vocab-Collector-and-Tester
My own personal vocabulary collector. No gui yet (probably never). Work in progress. Collect words in different languages in different lists.  Create quizes w write-in options, sentence completion, etc. 


## Completed:
* SQL user table
* some tests for creating username
* Add new user/ check if username already exists

## ToDo:
* fix: AttributeError: 'AddUserError' object has no attribute 'tb_frame'
* create table for users to create new vocabulary lists
* and a whole lot more - step by step!
