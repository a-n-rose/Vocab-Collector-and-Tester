# Vocab-Collector-and-Tester
My own personal vocabulary collector. Work in progress. Collect words in different languages in different lists.  Create quizes w write-in options, sentence completion, etc. 

## Current State:
User can create a username and with that username create multiple vocabulary lists. The user can add new words with a meaning and tags to those lists. 

## ToDo:
* fix new user function - don't want to add user if user already exists
* extend unittesting to sql functions..
* create quiz functionality
* add tag sorting functionality
