# Vocab-Collector-and-Tester
My own personal vocabulary collector. Work in progress. Collect words in different languages in different lists.  Create quizes w write-in options, multiple choice, "flashcards".

## Current State:

The user can:
* create account with non-protected password
* create multiple lists with tags
* add new words with a meaning, example sentences, tags
* view the word - meaning pairs in each list
* complete a fill-in-the-blank test for each list and earn a score
* test knowledge via flashcard, fill-in-the-blank, or multiple choice quizes 
* navigate between functionalities quite easily as well as exit at almost any input instance

## ToDo:
* further separate/organize functions --> apply test to them
* improve quiz functionality (account for the complexities of language)
* add tag sorting functionality
