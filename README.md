# Vocab-Collector-and-Tester
My own personal vocabulary collector. Work in progress. Collect words in different languages in different lists.  Create quizes w write-in options, sentence completion, etc. 

## Current State:
User can create a username and with that username create multiple vocabulary lists. The user can add new words with a meaning and tags to those lists. 

The user can:
* create account with non-protected password
* create multiple lists with tags
* add new words with a meaning, example sentences, tags
* view the word - meaning pairs in each list
* complete a fill-in-the-blank test for each list and earn a score
* navigate between functionalities quite easily as well as exit at almost any input instance

## ToDo:
* extend unittesting to sql functions..
* create quiz functionality
* add tag sorting functionality
